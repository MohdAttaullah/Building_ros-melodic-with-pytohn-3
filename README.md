# Building_ros-melodic-with-pytohn-3

These Steps Assumes few things:

You are familiar with ROS
You would like to run ROS Melodic in Ubuntu Linux 18.04 with Python3 support
You are familiar with the ROS build system
Familiar with the Linux command line, a shell like bash, and an editor like vim

#Remove all things python2 (Optional)
This step is optional, but I recommend it to have a clean build. Any other system packages that are removed can be reinstalled later by following the instructions here. So, to remove all python2 packages, execute the following on the command line:

$ sudo apt-get remove python-*
